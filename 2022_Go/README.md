Here I am, stressed out in the fall of 2023, looking for some coding challenges to get some 
chill time in the evenings. Go is on the rise, let's do that!

I even wrote a project with Go! I created a plugin to render Obsidian flavored markdown 
(callouts, mainly) to HTML and at that point I thought could turn that into something for once.
[Stay tuned I guess!](http://www.notespublish.com).

I first learned programming in Swift back in 2017 - and only realized how amazing it is years later.
Back then I was doing iOS, but nowadays I don't really have a use for Swift.

**BUT** I really like Godot and Swift has some pretty awesome looking bindings for it. I'd love to
make games with Swift - this could be the way. GDScript is cool and all, but I'm doubtful about how it
scales for bigger projects and teams (haha, man can dream). And I don't want to do C# man.. I didn't
escape Unity for this.

So... I guess let's brush up on some Swifting skills <3
